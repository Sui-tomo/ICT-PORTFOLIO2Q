        Welcome, this is my 2nd Quarter Portfolio where I will be sharing various experiences I had this year.

        On the right is a recent picture of the moon that I took. It looks very beautiful.

  <p> 
    I have learned and apply what I learned this quarter. I am able to create much more than what I was capable of and was able to express my findings
    within this website. I am grateful to Miss Uminga to be able to help me grow 
    as a programmer and I was proud of myself for not succumbing to the death known as procrastination. I realized that programming is not a mere hobby but rather it could be something more unique
    and could light inspiration in others curious about the technological world. Of course, I have frustrations in the 2nd Quarter but I am still grateful nonetheless, because there are many
    people who helped me realize my passion in broadening my mastery. To those people I share my cheers and gratitude to you.
